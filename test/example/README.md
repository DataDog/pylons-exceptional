# Testing/Example App

To run the unit tests, use `./manage.py test djexceptional`.

To run the example server, first write your API key to `./exceptional.key`
(which has conveniently been added to the `.gitignore` file) and then just use
`./manage.py runserver`. Visit <http://localhost:8000/> and then wait for the
exception to show up on <getexceptional.com>.
